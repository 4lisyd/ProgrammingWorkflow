I use the following programming frameworks, tools etc to make my workings faster and more efficient. With time we lose our muscle memory if we leave something for a while, this is repo right here is there to fix that.

(incomplete, still documenting as i get time)

1. TMUX
2. NVIM
3. Zsh + Oh-My-Zsh + powerlevel10k + Alacritty
4. OMZ plugins for terminal =(git autojump web-search zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)
5. venv + conda (package management)
6. Running scripts with persistence with Caffeine, amphatemine, tmux.
7. Python time optimisation, profiling with line_profiler.
